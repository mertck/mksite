  <p>Prof.Dr Style used a unique layout in order to prove a point while introducing its ideas in a historical manner. It made me realize in order to understand web design its important to look at older pages in order to understand its concept and how it has evolved. It was funny when the article mentioed that even though these sites are still being updates long past its date of creation there has been very little updates to them. It made me realize how these sites even if they look very simple they were there in order to fulfill its purpose of distributing information. Every little detail from links to the background color proves the change of development when it came to web design and displayed the intersection between simplicity/function following and making it look good. I probably miss those small moving gif icons from the early web because I remember when I was little they would always catch my attention. Majority of these things Lialina talks about are still relevant today as the layout is very important for displaying information and catching the user's attention.</p>
  <p>Schwulst's article really goes into the freedom of web development. I liked how it emphasized the importance of a connection through the web keeps getting more importsnt each day. She explains it as the author is the artist and the website that is going to be created is the canvas, the author is free to describe thier information on this canvas any way they want but there is different ways to get your message heard. I like how Schwulst connect websities to stuff found all around us which was a very effective way to show hoe web sities are formed and thier limitations. Like the example with the plant where the author said "the right soil, water it (but not too much), and provide adequate sunlight." it might give you a "fruit" in return. This helps show the importance of web development rules when setting up a website.  </p>
