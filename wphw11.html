    I have a good system to implement that factor of realization of how serious this virus is my adding a flipping number simulation right before the actual numbers come up. I haven’t implemented it yet but I feel like this would be a very good part to my project in order to get the main point in. Other than that, I have some simple divs set up as place holders just to see where the data is placed on the web page. The bottom half of the site seems pretty empty too so I am thinking to add something I formational there that’s related to the data from the api.
