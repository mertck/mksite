    One system that I would be interested in working on in the final is would be transportation based. It is one of the most complex systems I can think of that I could consider implementing as my final. Some of the important aspect to keep in mind that crucial to this system would be the time of day, if it’s a week day or not, how many train stations, length between each stop, weather, unexpected disturbances, pricing, timing of the schedule, and the technical part as well. After listing everything it made me realize how many factors come into play that help or affect transportation. This gave me an overall idea on how to set up and plan for my final project.

    This article was also another interesting one to read as well because I never really thought about how difficult it must have been to create a predicable result when the information given at hand it very mixed and unpredictable and most just use whatever information they have on hand. Setting up these models are very confusing and I might make something based on this for my final project.
