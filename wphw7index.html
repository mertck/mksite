For this assignment I wanted to build off on what I learned in class so I could practice the fuctionalities while adding something usefull to my page. I used new data that I am receiving from openweathermap.org since I wanted to try somthing new. I set up the JS file to first receive user input for the city of choice. Then using the keywords it would search for the city using the length. Later using json I have it set up to fetch the data from the api and using the math function it would round up the temperature by one. This was a fun assignment to work with and I used some examples from online to set up the css. It ws very interesting to see the data come up for cities around the world and it was very interesting how the weather was updated in real time.

<center><h3>Learning From Terminals to Design the Future of User Interfaces</h3></center>


<div class="center">
  <p>

    This was an very interesting read for me because I enjoy to read up on the UI and design elements these already well known sites have implemented on themselves. I was interesting to read upon specific examples of UI and UX fixes from current apps that use them such as the 1Password animation which is too heavy for the browser to smoothly implement. The article also brought up key components on how Terminal based programs are better going from interface elements to composability.

<center><h3>The Lost Ancestors of ASCII Art</h3></center>


<div class="center">
  <p>

    This article showed a great representation of ASCII art and shows the importance of it as it was able to tell stories and give a visual representation without the use of images. It was crazy how some of the images created using ASCII are very detailed and how this type of early art style on the web brought a new way of telling a story on the web.
    Itâ€™s crazy to realize that something I used to do for fun on AIM while messaging friends was actually a very effective way to create art and to portray a message
